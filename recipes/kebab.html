        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A very popular take-out especially after a night out at the pub. This favorite is so, so tasty--I'm sure once you try it, you'll certainly want to make more! Serve with warmed (lightly toasted) pita bread, chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. Also great to add as a topping for pizzas. Great to make in advance, slice and freeze.</p>
